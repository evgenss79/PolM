# Polymarket One-Click Bot 🚀

**Automated trading assistant for Polymarket "Up/Down 15m" markets with manual confirmation.**

This bot helps you trade BTC and ETH prediction markets on Polymarket by:
- ✅ Finding active markets automatically
- 📊 Analyzing real-time Chainlink price data
- 🎯 Recommending Up/Down decisions based on technical analysis
- 💰 Managing your stake with a progressive doubling system
- 🖱️ **Requiring your manual confirmation before every trade** (One-Click safety)

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Safety First

**This bot NEVER executes trades automatically.** After preparing each trade (selecting Up/Down and entering the amount), the bot pauses and waits for you to press **Enter**. This gives you full control while automating the analysis and decision-making.

## 🎯 What This Bot Does

### Market Discovery
- Connects to Polymarket's Gamma API to find active BTC/ETH "Up/Down 15m" markets
- Markets change every 15 minutes, and the bot finds the latest one automatically

### Price Analysis
- Connects to Polymarket's real-time data service (RTDS)
- Gets **Chainlink price feeds** - the same data Polymarket uses to settle markets
- Builds 1-minute candles from price ticks
- Calculates technical indicators:
  - **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)** - trend direction
  - **ATR (Average True Range)** - price volatility
  - **Returns** - recent price momentum

### Decision Engine
The bot analyzes current conditions and chooses Up or Down based on:

1. **Gap Analysis**: How far the current price is from the "price to beat"
2. **Time Pressure**: If close to market close, adjusts for realistic price movement
3. **Trend Detection**: Uses EMA crossovers and momentum to predict direction
4. **Clear Explanation**: Prints why it chose Up or Down in plain English

### Browser Automation
- Opens Polymarket in your Chrome browser
- Selects the recommended outcome (Up or Down)
- Enters your stake amount
- **Waits for you to press Enter**
- Only then clicks the "Buy" button

---

## 💰 How the Stake System Works

### Progressive Doubling Strategy

The bot uses a **streak-doubling** system to grow your stake:

1. **Start**: $2 USD
2. **Win**: Double your stake (2 → 4 → 8 → 16 → 32 → ...)
3. **Loss**: Reset to $2
4. **Max Streak**: 15 wins (then reset to $2)

### Example

| Trade | Result | Stake Before | Stake After | Streak |
|-------|--------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| 1     | WIN    | $2           | $4          | 1      |
| 2     | WIN    | $4           | $8          | 2      |
| 3     | LOSS   | $8           | $2          | 0      |
| 4     | WIN    | $2           | $4          | 1      |
| 5     | WIN    | $4           | $8          | 2      |
| 6     | WIN    | $8           | $16         | 3      |

### Safety Limits

- **Max Stake**: $1,024 (configurable in config.json)
- **Daily Trade Limit**: 10 trades per day (configurable)
- **Daily Loss Limit**: Stop if losses exceed $20 per day (configurable)

If any limit is hit, the bot stops and alerts you.

### Result Tracking

After each trade, the bot asks you to report the result:
- **W** = Win (price beat target, you won)
- **L** = Loss (price didn't beat target, you lost)
- **S** = Skip (trade cancelled or unknown)

The stake is adjusted accordingly, and the result is logged in `logs/trades.csv`.

---

## 🛠️ Installation (5 Steps)

### Prerequisites

- **Mac** (tested) or Linux (should work)
- **Python 3.8+** - [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Internet connection**
- **Polymarket account** - [Sign up here](https://polymarket.com)

### Step 1: Download the Code

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/evgenss79/PolM.git
cd PolM
```

### Step 2: Check Your Environment

Run the doctor script to verify everything is ready:

```bash
./scripts/doctor.sh
```

This will check:
- ✅ Python installation
- ✅ pip (Python package manager)
- ✅ Network connectivity to Polymarket
- ✅ Configuration files

If you see errors, follow the suggestions to fix them.

### Step 3: Create Configuration

Copy the example config and customize it:

```bash
cp config.json.example config.json
```

Open `config.json` in any text editor and review the settings. The defaults are good for beginners, but you can adjust:

- `base_stake_usd`: Starting stake (default: $2)
- `max_stake_usd`: Maximum allowed stake (default: $1,024)
- `daily_max_trades`: Max trades per day (default: 10)
- `daily_max_loss_usd`: Stop if daily losses exceed this (default: $20)

**Don't change** settings you don't understand - the defaults are safe!

### Step 4: Test the Environment

Run the doctor script again to make sure config.json is valid:

```bash
./scripts/doctor.sh
```

You should see: ✅ All checks passed!

### Step 5: You're Ready!

Proceed to "First-Time Setup" below to log into Polymarket.

---

## 🔐 First-Time Setup

### Logging Into Polymarket

The bot needs you to be logged into Polymarket so it can place trades on your behalf.

**First Run Only:**

1. Run the bot (we'll use BTC as an example):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_btc.sh
   ```

2. A Chrome window will open showing Polymarket
3. The bot will detect you're not logged in and pause
4. **Manually log into Polymarket** using your wallet or credentials
5. Once logged in, return to the terminal and press **Enter**

Your login session is saved in `.pw_profile/` and will persist for future runs. You won't need to log in again unless you clear this folder.

---

## 🚀 Running the Bot

### For Bitcoin (BTC)

```bash
./scripts/run_btc.sh
```

### For Ethereum (ETH)

```bash
./scripts/run_eth.sh
```

### Watch Mode (Continuous Trading)

To run the bot continuously and monitor for new markets:

```bash
./scripts/run_btc.sh --watch
```

In watch mode, the bot will:
- Check for new markets every 30 seconds
- Prepare a new trade when a fresh market appears
- Continue until you press Ctrl+C or daily limits are hit

**Note**: Even in watch mode, you must manually confirm each trade!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Python 3 not found"

**Mac:**
```bash
brew install python3
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

### "Could not find active market" or "Discovery failed"

**This happens when the bot cannot find a fresh 15-minute crypto market.**

The bot uses a **two-level discovery system**:

**LEVEL 1 (Gamma API - Primary)**:
- Queries Polymarket's Gamma API for active markets
- Searches for events matching `btc-updown-15m-*` or `eth-updown-15m-*`
- Selects the most recent event

**LEVEL 2 (UI Fallback)**:
- If Gamma API fails, scrapes `https://polymarket.com/crypto/15m`
- Finds the event link directly from the aggregator page
- More reliable but slower

**Why does Gamma API sometimes fail?**
- New 15m rounds start every 15 minutes (e.g., 14:00, 14:15, 14:30...)
- Gamma API may have a few seconds delay indexing the new event
- During this window, old event is closed and new one isn't indexed yet

**What to do:**
1. **Wait 30-60 seconds** - The new market will be indexed
2. **Run the bot again** - It will automatically use UI fallback if Gamma fails
3. **Check the logs** - Look for "PRIMARY DISCOVERY" and "FALLBACK DISCOVERY" messages
4. **Verify network** - Make sure you can access:
   - `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets`
   - `https://polymarket.com/crypto/15m`

**Example output when fallback works:**
```
🔍 PRIMARY DISCOVERY: Searching Gamma API for prefix: btc-updown-15m-
❌ PRIMARY DISCOVERY FAILED: No active markets found

🔄 FALLBACK DISCOVERY: Scraping UI for BTC 15m event...
   📍 Navigating to: https://polymarket.com/crypto/15m
   ✅ Found BTC event link: /event/btc-updown-15m-jan20-1430
✅ FALLBACK DISCOVERY SUCCESS!
```

### "Gamma returns future rounds" or "Selected wrong market time"

**This happens when Gamma API returns markets scheduled for the future instead of markets that are LIVE now.**

**The Fix (Implemented):**
- Discovery now filters markets by time using `startDate/endDate` fields from the API
- Only selects markets where `start <= now < end` (LIVE NOW)
- Future markets are automatically filtered out
- If no LIVE markets after filtering, falls back to UI scraping

**What you'll see in logs:**
```
🔍 PRIMARY DISCOVERY: Searching Gamma API for prefix: btc-updown-15m-
   📊 Gamma API returned 50 total markets
   📊 Found 10 markets matching prefix 'btc-updown-15m-'
   📊 After LIVE NOW filter: 1 markets (filtered out 9 future/past markets)
✅ PRIMARY DISCOVERY SUCCESS!
   Selected: LIVE market (start <= now < end)
   Slug: btc-updown-15m-jan20-1430
   Start: 2026-01-20 14:30:00 UTC
   End: 2026-01-20 14:45:00 UTC
   Reason: This market is LIVE NOW (among 1 live options)
```

**If all candidates are future markets:**
```
   📊 After LIVE NOW filter: 0 markets (filtered out 10 future/past markets)
❌ PRIMARY DISCOVERY FAILED: No LIVE markets found (all 10 candidates are future or past markets)
   This typically means:
   - Future markets scheduled but not started yet
   - API indexing delay for new rounds
   Falling back to UI scraping...
```

The bot will automatically use the UI fallback (`/crypto/15m`) which always shows the current LIVE market.

### "Could not find UP/DOWN button"

This means the page layout changed. Possible fixes:

1. **Manually select the outcome** in the browser, then let the bot continue
2. Check if you're on the correct market page
3. Wait a few seconds for the page to fully load
4. Report the issue so we can update the selectors

### "WebSocket connection failed"

Check your internet connection and firewall settings. The bot needs to connect to:
- `wss://ws-live-data.polymarket.com` (price feed)
- `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com` (market discovery)

### "Browser closes immediately"

Make sure you have enough disk space. Playwright downloads Chromium (~300MB) on first run.

### "Chromium crashes on macOS 15 arm64" or "SEGV_ACCERR error"

**macOS 15 (Sequoia) on Apple Silicon (arm64) has a known issue with Playwright's bundled Chromium (chromium-1097).**

**Solution**: Use system Chrome instead of bundled Chromium:

1. Install Google Chrome if not already installed: [Download Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
2. Update your `config.json` to use the Chrome channel:
   ```json
   "browser": {
     "channel": "chrome"
   }
   ```
3. Run the bot again - it will use your installed Chrome instead of bundled Chromium

**Note**: The example `config.json.example` already has `"channel": "chrome"` by default. If you created your config before this fix, add the `"channel": "chrome"` line to the `"browser"` section.

If you still experience issues, try:
- Updating Google Chrome to the latest version
- Removing the `.pw_profile` directory and logging in again

### "Daily loss limit exceeded"

The bot stops trading to protect you. This is intentional! Reset happens automatically at midnight UTC, or you can manually edit `state.json` (advanced users only).

### "Config file not found"

Run this:
```bash
cp config.json.example config.json
```

Then run the bot again.

---

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### 1. Manual Confirmation (One-Click)

**Every single trade requires your Enter key press.** There is no way to bypass this. The bot will never click "Buy" without your explicit confirmation.

### 2. No API Keys or Private Keys

The bot does NOT:
- Store your private keys
- Access your wallet directly
- Make on-chain transactions programmatically

All trades happen through Polymarket's web UI, just as if you were clicking manually.

### 3. Session Persistence

Your Polymarket login is saved in `.pw_profile/` for convenience, but this is a standard browser profile - the same security as Chrome/Firefox profiles on your computer.

### 4. Daily Limits

- **Max trades per day**: Prevents over-trading
- **Max loss per day**: Stops if you lose too much
- **Max stake**: Prevents accidental huge bets

All configurable in `config.json`.

### 5. Stake Reset

Even on a winning streak, the stake resets after 15 wins. This prevents exponential growth from becoming risky.

### 6. Logging

All decisions and trades are logged to `logs/` folder:
- `decisions.csv` - Every decision the bot makes
- `trades.csv` - Every trade you execute

Review these files to track performance and debug issues.

### Beginner-Friendly Tweaks

**To be more aggressive:**
- Increase `daily_max_trades` to 20
- Increase `daily_max_loss_usd` to 50

**To be more conservative:**
- Decrease `base_stake_usd` to 1
- Decrease `max_stake_usd` to 256
- Decrease `daily_max_trades` to 5

**To change time window:**
- `min_seconds_before_close`: Don't trade if market closes in less than this (prevents last-second volatility)
- `max_seconds_before_close`: Don't trade if market closes in more than this (avoid early trades)

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Do I need a Polymarket account?

**A:** Yes. Sign up at [polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com) and fund your account.

### Q: How much money do I need?

**A:** Start with $50-100. The bot begins with $2 stakes, so you have plenty of runway.

### Q: Can this bot run 24/7 automatically?

**A:** **NO.** The bot requires manual confirmation for every trade. This is a safety feature, not a bug.

### Q: What if I want to change the decision logic?

**A:** Edit `src/strategy.py`. But be careful - wrong changes can lead to bad trades!

### Q: How accurate is the bot?

**A:** The bot is a **decision assistant**, not a crystal ball. It uses technical analysis, which works sometimes but not always. **Trade at your own risk.**

### Q: What happens if my internet disconnects?

**A:** The bot will stop. It cannot reconnect mid-trade. Close it and restart.

### Q: Can I run BTC and ETH bots simultaneously?

**A:** Technically yes (in separate terminals), but not recommended for beginners. Stick to one at a time.

### Q: What's the "watch mode"?

**A:** Normal mode runs once and exits. Watch mode continuously monitors for new markets and offers to trade each one. You still confirm each trade manually.

### Q: Where are my trade results stored?

**A:** In `logs/trades.csv` and `state.json`. Back these up if you want to preserve history.

### Q: Can I customize the stake amounts?

**A:** Yes! Edit `config.json`:
- `base_stake_usd`: Change starting amount
- `max_stake_usd`: Change maximum

But be careful with high values - you can lose real money!

### Q: What if the bot makes a wrong decision?

**A:** You can always **close the browser** instead of pressing Enter. The trade won't execute.

### Q: How do I update the bot?

**A:** Pull the latest code:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

Then re-run `./scripts/doctor.sh` to check for new dependencies.
